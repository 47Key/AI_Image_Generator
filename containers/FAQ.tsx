                AI Image generation is a tool that allows you to generate images from text inputs, 
                it allows you to turn your thoughts into a real image, regardless of traditional 
                artistic skills. 

                Stable Diffusion is a type of AI Image generation, it uses a latent diffusion model 
                to transform text into images. It can also generate images based off of an image input  
                and text guidance. Which is a feature we are implementing soon.

                Yes it is free ! This link has only been shared with close friends and family, 
                as well as potential employers of the developer. This website will soon require 
                authentication and an account to use freely. For the time being it is completely free!

                I want to make sure everyone gets the chance at using this technology, and understand the 
                future impact that these tools can have on humanity. AI is on the precipice of *magic* 
                and human ingenuity.
